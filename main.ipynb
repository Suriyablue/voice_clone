He is not a thief, he is not even talking about me.  This weekend, I got a DM from him.  So, you asked me what happened.  Today, we are going to watch the whole of India.  All the Indians and the world are talking about this podcast with Vijay Malia.  He has been telling me about what really happened to him.  One side is Katrina Kaif, the other side is Deepika Padukone, the other side is Virat Kohli.  Vijay Malia has been among the stars all around him.  Today, in some country, when he has been taking over the bank completely, he is trying to win.  The reason is that he has been sitting in the United Kingdom for so many years.  He has made a mistake in the court he is in.  But he has been telling me that he made a mistake.  So, what is happening? Let's watch it in detail.  Before that, if you want to know about the world of flans, subscribe to Madan Gauri's channel and join the MG Squad.  Let's start now.  Hello everyone, I am Madan Gauri and hello my dear MG Squad.  What is the first thing?  He has been talking about Rajshamani in his podcast.  He is saying that he is not a thief.  He is saying that he is not a thief.  He is also saying that he is not a thief.  He has been talking about it for 4 hours.  Today, in the video, he went to India for the first time in 10 years.  Many people are probably watching this video.  He has been around Vijay Malia, Virat Kohli, Katrina Kaif, Deepika Padukone, Nikka, IPL, etc.  So, who is the first Vijay Malia according to Indian media?  In fact, he is also saying that he made a mistake in the Indian media.  Many people are talking about the Indian media.  He is saying that he made a mistake in the Indian media.  So, what is the first thing he is saying about Indian media?  He has said that he is not a thief.  He is also saying that he is not a thief.  He is also saying that he has actually done something wrong.  The first thing he is saying is that he is a businessman who ran away from his country.  He is a fugitive.  He is looking for a person who is arrested in India and he is in jail.  He has ran away from his country.  Why should he run away from his country?  So, let us look at a small flashback.  Vijay Malia is a very rich man.  He is the owner of a very good company.  He is a very flashy man since his childhood.  Since his childhood, he has loved automobiles.  He has dated a lot of people.  He is also a king.  He has grown up like that.  When I grew up in a podcast,  the things he said were very luxurious for India.  Coming back to the topic,  when Vijay Malia grew up,  when he was very young,  he had to head a big industry.  When he came back, he rebranded a lot.  What are the famous brands in India?  Kingfisher's alcohol division is complete.  Kingfisher said that  we will remember water and water.  We will remember both.  Kingfisher Airlines.  It is not known to the generation.  Kingfisher Airlines has all the problems.  I will tell you about all the problems in Kingfisher Airlines.  In that case, he said that he had spent a lot of money.  He said that he had spent a lot of money.  He said that he had spent a lot of money.  We will come back to that.  F1.  It is one of the costliest sports in the world.  It is a very light sport.  In that, he had a team-one.  In Bangalore,  the most luxurious mall in Bangalore was  UBC team mall.  It was with him.  If you wear shoes,  we will say it was in Bangalore.  In that, it was parked as a high end mall.  If you wear slippers,  they will say that they will not enter.  I have gone.  It is a very scary mall  that builds up in that way.  RCP.  In IPL.  One side was in North Ambani.  In South, it was Vijay Malia.  No one can ask.  Mukesh Ambani.  Like our Mukesh Bhai,  he is the second generation.  His father was Malia.  He is Malia's next generation.  This is a small backdrop.  We will talk about Ambani.  He is a rich man.  But Mukesh Ambani is a rich man.  He is very humble and sweet.  Vijay Malia is the opposite.  He is the rich man.  He is very glamorous.  He is very flashy.  This is Vijay Malia.  Vijay Malia had a house  for any kind of flashy.  UBC team mall.  On top of that,  there is a big mansion  that looks like Bangalore.  There is a building on top of it.  You have never seen an image like this.  Such a luxurious life.  Vijay Malia is a life  where people live like Malaya.  He is a public life.  We may not know Mukesh Ambani.  He did not show it.  Vijay Malia showed it.  Media celebrated it.  This is the matter.  F1 team,  cricket team,  kingfisher,  beer team,  flight team,  all of them are a king.  That is Vijay Malia.  We will come to the next step.  Vijay Malia has started  to run his flight company.  Airlines is a tough field in India.  It is very difficult.  Even if you are in a flight,  even if it is a small problem,  people get tensed.  They get tensed.  It is a very sensitive business.  He starts it in 2000.  Kingfisher is way ahead of its time.  It is important to be in India.  From Surarai's movie,  till now,  it is a cost tour.  But he focused on luxury.  He focused on giving  a luxurious experience to everyone in India.  He started it.  Initially, the hype did not run  for long.  He could not run the company.  He could not run the company.  What did Vijay Malia do?  He is getting a lot of loan.  He is getting thousands of crores.  He is getting 9000 crores in Indian media.  He explains it later.  He said,  he is getting 9000 crores in Indian media.  He can not run the company.  He cannot run the company.  His salary is 9000 crores.  What should we do?  We are all loaned to the bank.  We deposit it to the bank.  Where is our money?  In the SBI.  It is in Indian banks.  He is getting 9000 crores.  He is running the company.  He can not run the company.  At the same time,  there is a lot of money.  He is getting 9000 crores.  He is getting a lot of money.  A company who can not run the company  could not give him money.  He could not get the money.  What is ED?  In Rs. 9000 crores,  Vijay Malia has got lots of money.  How can he earn it?  He has a F1 team.  A luxurious team  and a bigger motor sports team.  He is giving an advertisement  to the king.  He spends a lot of money.  So, the left hand is going to the right hand.  That is very expensive for that.  This is not right.  Second thing is,  Let the luxury mansions be huge in the UK.  Many things are added to the personal property  from the loan he bought.  The loan is given to the Indian person  and the ED is given to him.  This is a criminal case.  If you cannot run a business that you buy a loan from,  then you can take the loan from  your own guarantee.  They will sell it and pay for it.  This is over for the bank.  But if you want to run a business  and you want to run a business,  then you can take the loan from your own  and buy a big villa.  If you want to make your F1 team  more profitable, then you can sell the money.  That is wrong.  So, this is the basic problem.  When he is like this,  he has 2nd case on him.  He ran away from the country  and settled in the UK.  After settling in the UK,  he went to the bank and filed a case.  There are 10 plus banks in India  who have been affected by the loan.  Everyone should return the money because  it is the money of new people.  They have paid for the money in the business.  If he is successful, he will give it to the bank  and give it to the bank.  But when he bought the money from the people  and gave the loan to the bank,  he ran away from the country.  He went to the UK and filed a case.  In the UK case,  it is also wrong.  When he said he will return the money,  he said he will give it to the bank.  So, this is the podcast.  This is the story.  He has been like this for 10 years.  This is the media.  Now, we will go into his podcast.  I have put a flashback of who has happened.  Now, we will go into his story.  First,  all is fine.  But where did this 9000 crore loan come from?  It is 6000 crores  including the entire interest.  You can say it is 9000 crores.  This is a false propaganda.  He started it and broke it.  He said it is a proof and showed some things.  He said that it is not a proof.  But he said that it is 9000 crores.  So, 6000 crores  is the interest of the money.  After he left the country,  he has a lot of cases.  Including the pent house  and the big house,  the share he has with the RCB,  the government and the banks  have made money out of it.  In fact, he has earned 14000 crores.  The amount of money he has bought  is 6000 crores.  The amount of interest he has to give  is 6000 crores.  You have made 14000 crores  more than double the amount of money.  How can I steal?  I have bought this money  in my personal guarantee.  I can't run my business.  You have made money out of it.  How can I steal?  But why are you telling me to steal?  The question is,  what is the next thing?  The most important thing in the podcast  is a watch.  The watch's price is 40 lakhs.  The watch is available in the media.  The watch is available in the media.  The watch is available in the media.  The watch is available in the big mansion.  How many Kingfisher airlines  have employees  who have worked hard  in the last few days.  Even now, the criticism is increasing.  What is the story behind this?  Kingfisher Airways is starting.  I have mentioned about Vijay Malia.  He is MP.  He is a member of parliament.  He is one of the highest  people in India.  He has gone there twice.  You have made 4-5 businesses.  You can't run a business.  What do you do at that time?  Do you have to pay someone  for their business?  But he didn't pay them.  He didn't pay them.  There are many pilots.  There are many cabin crew.  Cabin crew.  There are many like that.  When you run a big flight,  you have to work hard  to get a luggage.  There are many like that.  What are you going to say to them?  I have told them in the podcast.  If they don't have money,  I will ask them.  I tried.  But because I already have money,  the government  gave me money.  So, I couldn't give them money.  I felt sorry for them.  After 10 years, they have told me.  What is the next thing?  Why can't you do  a successful business in India?  You are a successful businessman.  Kingfisher is a  brand. You have changed your lifestyle.  Deepika Padukone, Katrina.  She is famous.  You have a glamour.  You have sports.  Kingfisher has good times.  You have a strong branding.  Why can't you run airlines?  What is he going to say?  See, business is everything.  When I was a kid,  I didn't know how to behave  with seniors, juniors.  When I was 20,  when I was 20,  I came to the business.  It was very difficult to run a business.  One thing to say as a candidate  is that if you run a successful business in India,  29 chief ministers  should be in your good books.  You should be happy to deal with all the people.  It is important to deal with 29 chief ministers.  Which is nothing but India.  Chief ministers in all states  should be in your good touch.  That is a big challenge.  There are many layers of politics, bureaucracy.  It is easy to do business.  It is not a great thing  but he has said that.  Because his country is India.  Everyone in the world will see what he is saying.  Anyway, he has said that.  What is he going to say?  When I was thinking to run airlines in India,  I was very proud  to be in this position.  Because I have taken the fun element  and targeted youngsters.  That is the market, IPL,  F1, that is my branding.  I did all that.  But when it comes to flight,  I was unable to run it.  In 2008, a global financial crisis  came.  The world was facing a big financial crisis.  That is what affected it.  The oil market became more.  And fuel was a very important thing for the flight.  Because of this,  I was unable to run the flight.  And then I went to  the finance minister Pranab Mukherjee.  After that, the president also came.  I told him that I could not run the flight.  I wanted to make my company work.  Because of this, the company is getting bigger and bigger.  That is why I am thinking to run it.  I am going to lay off.  It is important to save the company.  When I say that even in the future,  I will be able to run it.  What they said is, do not do that.  They are studying a lot and are working.  If you go to work, it is a big problem in India.  So, without closing the company,  what you should do is,  you should buy a loan and run the company.  After that, the crisis started to grow.  Pranab Mukherjee said  that it is important to remember  that Pranab Mukherjee is not alive  to say that he is not alive.  I am a little confused about this.  Because I am coming to the 2nd issue.  Anyway, Pranab Mukherjee said  to the finance minister, do not send anyone to work.  Even if the company is lost, it is okay to run the company.  That is why I bought a big loan.  I bought it for 6000 crores.  I bought it for 6000 crores of interest.  To guarantee that, I  personally signed the loan.  If I was a thief, I would have signed it personally.  I signed it personally.  The next issue is,  it is all top class.  Who should be the cabin crew?  I selected them personally.  How to serve them, how to speak to them.  I personally  wanted to give top end experience  to the Indians.  After that, in 2008,  the crisis started to grow.  The company bought a big loan and ran the company.  Even then, we could not run successfully.  That is why the company failed.  After the company failed,  the bank started to return the money.  At that time, I could not return the money.  I was continuously in trouble.  Then, I went to Arun Jait.  I went to the parliament  and said that  I will leave the country.  I told them that I will leave the country.  He said that.  Now, he left the country.  The next day, the big problem was  that he bought the money and ran the business.  That is the news.  Arun Jait also said that  he is not alive.  That is the news.  At that time, Arun Jait said that  he will leave the country.  I went to the parliament.  When I went to the parliament,  he ran to me and talked to me.  After that, I had many cases.  I did not have to entertain.  That is why I left the country.  He gave me an appointment  and gave me permission to leave the country.  He told me that  someone is giving me an appointment.  I went to the parliament.  Then, he clarified that  he is not alive.  After many years, he had a podcast.  He is quoting the name of two politicians.  He said that he is not alive.  Someone named him is not alive.  He clarified that he is not alive.  He used the name of two politicians.  He said that he is not alive.  I was not alive.  Anyway, I continued.  He said that  he could not run the company  because he could not do it.  I have a different opinion.  In 2025,  this story will be  20 years old.  In 2005,  20 years ago, it is difficult.  Coming back to the topic,  two decades later,  we have a personal experience.  We have a flight ticket friend  and we have an experience.  When we book a flight ticket,  we will book a majority of Indians.  We will not say,  we are very super!  We can book it like Visthara.  We will book the majority.  We will book the flight that is available at the time.  20 years ago,  I said that I will give a premium experience  and I will give a premium experience.  I will give a premium experience.  I will give a premium experience.  Even then,  India is a price sensitive market.  I am curious.  It is a major reason.  But in India, you cannot run an ultra luxurious flight at this scale.  It is a true thing.  Anyway, what the next person says is that  I have settled with many banks.  I have said that I have settled four banks.  But banks do not agree.  The fact-checkers say that it is true.  They have said that they have settled four banks.  But they have said that they have settled four banks.  They have said that they have settled four banks.  They have said that they have settled four banks.  They are the only people who are able to pay for banks.  They have agreed to do so.  The SBI has agreed to do so.  SBI has also agreed to do so.  Every small company in Vavasai and IT companies  have a big salary account in their bank.  Every small company is able to pay for banks.  The government is not sure how the government will pay for them.  But Malaya has said that it is true.  This is true. He said that he is settling for the truth.  Basically, Vijay Malayana is telling his whole podcast.  Media has made a huge villain.  Why did they make a villain?  It is worth 9000 crores.  9000 crores is the default of Kingfisher Airlines.  They changed it to give 9000 crores to me.  Media is telling about clickbait, TRP, etc.  In general public opinion, media has made a villain.  So, to play with that, the government is talking about it.  In fact, I was so bad.  But I didn't do this podcast.  I said that I will return to India.  If I don't say that, I will return to India.  He said that.  If I say that, I will return to India.  I will return to India.  But I have a legal trial.  When I return to India, I will say that I will not be seen by anyone.  And another thing is...  Okay. Vijay Malayana said all that.  Now, I will tell you about his case in UK.  After I went there, I said that the Indian banks have put a case there.  In India, he has a mistake.  If there is a mistake, they are saying 9000 crores.  I am saying that there is a mistake in the media.  In that, he has spent a lot of money in the shop he bought.  He has spent a lot of money on his own personal benefit.  There should be proof for that.  India is saying that.  India's banks are saying that.  India's ED is also saying that.  This has been discussed in the UK as well.  See, this is an important thing.  It is not a big problem for people in India to do this.  But this has been discussed in the UK as well.  Vijay Malayana said that they are doing this for Chumatiyar Pika.  They have done this for the public.  So, why did they do this in the UK?  Even in the United Kingdom, there is a mistake on him.  He has used some personal things.  They are also saying that.  Not only that, they have also given permission to return him to India.  Now, let's see what he is saying in the middle.  He is saying that he is going to put a case in Human Rights.  I am going back to India.  But there is no human rights level in the jail in India.  Look at the world level.  In India, there is a very bad situation.  Human rights are being treated in the jail.  You are sending me back.  There is a last thing for the human rights.  That is why the case is getting bigger.  EU's rules.  Europe's standards are there.  India's standards are there in the jail.  He is saying that there is no legal issue when he returns.  Okay?  Even now, he has earned a lot of money from Vijay.  He has a lot of international business.  He has seen many crores a week or a few crores a year 10 years ago.  But still, he is not like that.  He has not lost everything completely.  Like I said, he has spent 40 lakhs.  But he has said that he can take some things.  It is a very easy question to do business in India.  He is saying that he should keep the 29th Chief Minister happy.  Probably, many businessmen are watching this.  In many states, you know how hard it is to do business.  Have you ever given bribe or lunch to a place?  He is saying that he has done what he has to do.  If he says that he has done it, he will lose all his justice.  It is wrong to buy a loan and it is wrong to give it.  It is wrong to ask and give it.  But he cannot agree that he gave the loan.  Basically, this scene comes from Shivaji's movie.  Did you give the loan?  Yes, I did.  I was cornered. I was helpless.  But the case should not have been given.  The case should have come to court.  But in many situations, Vijay Malia is saying that he has done what he has to do.  So, this is what I am saying in the podcast.  I have taken all the mistakes.  At the same time, Vijay Malia has spoken without talking for years.  One mistake.  But he has not spoken.  We can always say that we are 100% right and wrong.  But on this side, he is representing big banks like SBI.  The advocate who pursues this case.  Or those who are involved should also talk in the podcast.  They should also talk for 5 hours.  Any point by point.  This should be said right and wrong.  If it is said, Vijay Malia is right and wrong.  If Vijay Malia is not wrong, he will not say it.  He is the fugitive.  He is the one who ran away.  He is the one who agrees.  But he is not a thief.  So, on this side, everyone is sitting.  He is not a thief.  To promote the airlines,  he has to spend a lot on his own phone and advertise.  Where does it go to the pocket?  It goes back to his pocket.  He gets the money from the people.  He gets it for the airlines.  He promotes the airlines and gives a lot of money to the phone and advertise.  But the F1 team is with him.  So, to get the money for the airlines,  it goes back to his pocket.  What many people say is that  it will cost a lot to advertise on the phone.  In his team, there is another team.  What is wrong with this?  No, no.  This is still wrong.  It is said that it is done to earn a personal income.  It is said as ED.  It is said as enforcement retreat.  So, these are the overall perspectives.  As I said, the name of the two politicians  is the name of the person who died.  Some of them are alive.  On the opposite side,  there are some countermeasures and income.  So, without any reason,  the name of the person who died is said to be the name of the person who died.  And the third thing is,  this is a hypothesis.  I told him that I would send him.  The case is going on.  It is slowly progressing.  Even so, if India is extradited by Vijay Mallya,  if it is sent back,  this podcast will favor his side a lot.  Because in public perception,  he created a very strong image that he did not steal.  So, these are the overall 360 degree observance.  I did not take any of my personal take in this video.  I am talking about the overall 360 degree,  what the media is talking about,  what the critics are saying,  what the supporters are saying,  what Vijay Mallya is saying,  what is happening in the podcast,  I have taken it from you.  You judge this in the comment section.  Overall, when you see all this,  what do you think?  Do you think Vijay Mallya is wrong or not?  What is your opinion in the comment section?  What is this like?  If I want to talk about the next videos,  subscribe to M.G Squad.  And personally,  what I want to talk about next is,  this video is like that,  you DM everyone on Instagram.
